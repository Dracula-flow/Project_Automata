PROJECT AUTOMATA. OR HOW I LEARNT TO LOVE SELENIUM

In the context of my journey as a tester, I needed to learn how to use Selenium.

I decided that a practical application of the framework would do wonders for the development of my skills. 

This is just an exemplificative and experimentative project, trying to see what works, what doesn't and what could be better.

As per requirements, the language is going to be Python and python-related libraries. You can find the complete list of them in the file "requirements.txt"
